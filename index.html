            <h3>Mohammed al-Durra</h3>
            <p>On 30 September 2000, the second day of the Second Intifada, 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durrah   was killed in the Gaza Strip during widespread protests and riots across the Palestinian territories against Israeli military occupation. Jamal al-Durrah and his son Muhammad were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian television cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between the Israeli military and Palestinian security forces. Footage shows them crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust. Muhammad is shown slumping as he is mortally wounded by gunfire, dying soon after </p>

The Rafah massacre or the tents massacre is a massacre committed by the Israeli Air Force against the Palestinians on the eve of May 26, 2024, when warplanes launched airstrikes at around 9:00 pm on the surrounding area of ​​the barracks housing displaced persons northwest of Rafah. Minutes later, the warplanes resumed their raids, targeting the tents of the displaced near the UNRWA warehouses in the northwest of Rafah as well.  This Israeli attack resulted in the deaths of at least 45 Palestinians, a large number of whom were children and women, most of whom were displaced persons. Dozens were injured with amputations and severe burns, and the situation worsened in light of the ongoing Israeli blockade on the Strip and the prevention of the entry of sufficient medical aid, at least, and in light of the cessation of most hospitals in the Strip as a result of the Israeli targeting</p>

        <h2>Why Does the Occupation Want Palestine?</h2>
        <p>After World War I, the Zionist movement, which was founded in the late 19th century by Theodor Herzl, intensified its efforts to establish a national homeland for the Jewish people. The primary goal of the Zionist movement was to find a safe place for Jews, who were facing persecution in Europe.

Initially, Palestine was not the only option considered. Herzl had proposed the idea of creating a Jewish state in Argentina due to its vast land and natural resources, which he believed could provide a suitable environment for a Jewish homeland.

Later, in 1903, the British government offered the Zionist movement the possibility of establishing a Jewish homeland in Uganda (in a region that is now part of Kenya). This offer was made in response to increasing persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe, and Britain saw it as a temporary solution to protect the Jewish people. The proposal was discussed at the Sixth Zionist Congress but was met with strong opposition from most Zionists, who rejected the idea and insisted on Palestine as their historical and religious homeland.

It's important to note that the argument of a religious connection to the land is often used as justification for the Zionist claim to Palestine. However, if the connection to the land were purely religious, proposals like Uganda or Argentina would never have been considered. The fact that these alternatives were seriously discussed shows that the movement's goals were driven by political and practical considerations rather than solely by religious beliefs.

And even with these justifications, can this truly justify the killing of so many innocent people? Is it a valid reason for the violence and displacement that has occurred?

        <p>Currently, Gaza is experiencing intense military escalation by Israeli forces. The heavy attacks have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and the displacement of around 90% of Gaza's population. Residents face severe shortages of food, water, and basic resources amid the destruction that has affected 80% of buildings. Additionally, journalists are being directly targeted, with 116 killed since the war began in October 2023.</p>
